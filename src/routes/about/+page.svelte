				<h3>Interests</h3>
				<p>
					I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Justworks, where I focus on building technology that improves the lives of
					everyday people. One of the projects I’m most proud of is designing and building Cross-border Payment
					Orchestration using Ruby on Rails and Temporal. It was a large, impactful effort that enabled our platform
					to support more countries and significantly improved the developer experience for engineers working on our
					international products. I have a flexible work style and enjoy diving into complex challenges that create
					real value for others.
				</p>
				<p>
					I grew up in the Midwest and currently live in Raytown, Missouri—a small suburb just outside of Kansas City.
					When I’m not working, I love spending time with my wife and our seven pets (three dogs and four cats),
					usually binge-watching TV or taking on DIY projects like replacing flooring or landscaping. I’m also a huge
					fan of board games, video games, and fantasy sports, and I follow the Kansas City Royals, St. Louis
					Cardinals, and Kansas City Chiefs pretty religiously. Crochet and traveling are also high on my list of
					hobbies when I get the chance.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of my biggest goals is to start my own company someday—something that continues my mission of creating
					thoughtful, people-first solutions. More than anything, I want to have a positive impact on the world around
					me, whether that's through my work, the way I show up for others, or the communities I’m a part of. I'm
					driven by purpose, grounded in curiosity, and always looking for the next opportunity to build something
					meaningful.
